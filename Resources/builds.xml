          the purpose of the build is to get damage done with the mine drop and then walk across the map with finished stim and 1-2 medivacs to try and delay or cancel a third base. Polt is unable to do that in the replay because of the DT's keeping him in the base but he was able to get a sizable amount of probe kills.&#xD;

          this is a build polt did in the most recent tournament (which he won) against the grandmaster terran player KoMA. you make 4 reapers total while pooling them back at home and once the 3rd and 4th reapers come out you make a reactor then a tech lab for fast marine production and stim. you push out when your combat shields has only been going for 10-15 seconds so that you show up just as its finishing. with this push you should have a group of marines, 3 tanks, 2 medivacs, and 1 viking. if your below masters this build will most likely kill your opponent but above that it should contain them while you get up to 3 base and rocket ahead in economy. id recommend watching the replay that is attached to this build order just to see how a pro like polt tries to play it out, i condensed the build order down to 5:30 as opposed to the standard 10:00 since i feel that after that point its all standard reactionary play and no longer part of the build order. if you feel differently the link attached to this build will take you to the full 10:00 version.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          P.S. the turrets he puts down at 5:14 and 5:15 are reaction to scouting possible banshee. they are not part of the real build order but if your less experienced id recommend doing it anyways just for safety.&#xD;

          Early economic head start, protected by Queens and lings for the first minutes, transition into a fast and strong timing attack with Roaches when +1/+1 and speed finishes.&#xD;

          This is a guide on how to open safely in PvP and transition into the midgame to get the compostion you want. I also discuss the numerous things I think when playing PvP and how to handle the numerous attacks that come at you. I encourage you to watch my YT vid along with just the build order because there is a lot to be learned in all the variance you face.* Note: I don't usually open 2gate defensive style, but I had just played this opponent, however; it is not bad to open 2 gate for safety especially in lower leagues where you can be less sure with what you are facing/ lots of early aggresion builds!*&#xD;

          A safe 3 hatch before pool opening which makes use of a small window in the early game economy, at 28 supply, to squeeze in a safety roach warren whilst waiting for your 3rd hatch to finish, freeing up supply to drone freely once more.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          In case of adepts, build roaches.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          If there are signs of heavy adept harassment, make just enough roaches to hold against the level of the protoss commitment to the harass.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          Otherwise, continue saturating the natural and take 2 more geysers. Saturate the 3rd, and take a 4th gas + macro hatch.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          A good time for the macro hatch, if the early game has gone smoothly, is between 4-5 minutes when the economy kicks in and you start banking minerals beyond your production levels on 3 hatches alone.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          Make lots of units in reaction to the protoss tech choice. Landsharks and ravagers and lurkers, oh my!&#xD;
          &#xD;
          Expand to a 4th base as soon as it is safe to.&#xD;

          Very easy-to-execute build that involves a very effective harass and punch that crushes under prepared players, and even the smallest miss micro can be game losing for the enemy. This build is most effective in PvP, winning games even in Diamond league, works well against Zerg, and against Terran, however some platinum Terrans will defend this.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
          Against Protoss:&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Leave 2 Stalkers in mineral line until you are 100% sure that your opponent has no stargates whatsoever. This is hard to know for sure, but if your opponent is on a one base with a robotics facility, there's a good chance he couldn't have afforded a stargate. (This is optional until higher leagues, if you need the extra 2 stalkers for damage, or would rather not worry about it, you'll probably be just fine)&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -First warp in should always be all stalkers so you can focus down enemy MSC as fast as possible.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Be cautious of Pylon overcharge, either commit to killing the pylon, or back off. It can be game losing if you do something in the middle.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -If he has any sentries, focus them fast and concentrate everything on being able to move up the ramp so he can't block off reinforcements.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Focus immortals quick. First trigger their shield by focusing a single unit on it, then focus everything after it goes away.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
          Against Zerg:&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Build your structures near the ramp, helps with rush defense&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Be very careful with the adepts, you need them to kill zerglings.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -If your opponent is going pure zerglings, make zealots and adepts.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -If your opponent is going roach/ravager, make stalkers and zealots. Focus ravagers quick, and focus roaches so they die quicker and can do less damage.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Sometimes I like to wall off my base with a pylon and put a mothership core at the ramp, in case opponent tries to counter attack, if you decide to make a mothership core, feel free to be aggressive with it, and recall if necessary.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
          Against Terran&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Make a mothership core after the first 2 adepts. This is really helpful for vision of high ground, being able to attack their ramp, and defending reapers easily.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -If they don't have much, just walk pass any bunkers. If they do have much, try to shade the adepts to their mineral line, and attack with stalkers/zealots at the front in order to split up their army. Adepts evaporate marines in 2 shots.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
          Against All:&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Stop making probes when you have 16 on minerals, and 2 on each gas. This does not include the worker you send off to make the proxy.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Don't forget to be aggressive with the adepts as soon as they come out. Take advantage of their ability to get to the enemy base fast.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Shade to their mineral lines and focus workers. Do not A click. That is a waste. If they're moving a decent amount of forces towards the adepts, immediately shade them outside the base, but continue to focus workers while the timer goes.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          -Don't be afraid to back off and wait for another warp in, but be smart about it. This can allow a protoss to get sentries for wallins, terran to get tanks/widow mines set up, and zerg to counter attack or get more spines/queens. Make sure it's the right play.&#xD;
          &#xD;
          &#xD;
